## Development and Deployment Process

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides a modular framework that enables developers to create, evaluate, and deploy AI agents effectively. The development process begins with setting up your environment by installing the toolkit. Using Python, you can define agent logic and orchestration directly, allowing for flexibility and easier testing capabilities [1][2].

Once your basic agent is established, developers can enhance its functionality by integrating various pre-built tools or creating custom functions. ADK supports multi-agent systems, enabling sophisticated applications by combining specialized agents to tackle complex workflows [3][4]. Google offers extensive documentation and sample agents to accelerate this phase, although some examples may still be in progress [5][6].

Deployment options are versatile, allowing agents to run locally during development or be deployed on Google Cloud for production use via services like Vertex AI or Kubernetes [7][8]. This seamless transition focuses on delivering enterprise-grade applications while supporting multiple model integrations [9]. Best practices encourage utilizing the evaluation framework provided to ensure robust performance [10].
